# Successful deployment

A well-executed SaaS procurement only succeeds if it leads to **smooth implementation** and **sustained user adoption**. To realize the full value of your investment, plan for deployment with the same level of care and intention you used in acquisition. A thoughtful, **user-centered rollout strategy**, when the **government and the vendor work together**, reduces risk, builds trust, and accelerates the path to mission impact.

Active partnership ensures alignment on timelines, data readiness, system configuration, and training support-‚Äîallowing both parties to proactively address challenges before and adapt to evolving needs during rollout.

## üß≠ Develop a phased implementation strategy

Avoid a big bang rollout--they often fail. Instead, adopt a **phased approach** to implementation that allows for learning, refinement, and risk mitigation.

- Define **implementation phases** with clear milestones and checkpoints.
- Start with a **pilot user group** to test the solution, gather feedback, and make adjustments before agencywide deployment.
- Plan a **data migration strategy** with realistic timelines and validation checkpoints.
- Establish **acceptance criteria** for each phase to confirm readiness before scaling.
- **Plan** to manage unexpected issues during deployment.

## üßë‚Äçüè´ Design a comprehensive training and support program

Effective user adoption depends on training that is **role-specific, relevant, and accessible**.

- Identify distinct **user roles** (e.g., end users, administrators, help desk, staff) and tailor training to their needs.
- Develop training materials aligned with **actual agency workflows and use cases**.
- Provide **multiple training formats** to meet different learning styles and availability:
  - Instructor-led (virtual or in-person).
  - Self-paced eLearning.
  - Embedded help and knowledge base articles.
  - On-demand videos or short topic-based tutorials.
- Offer job aids and **quick reference guides** to reinforce learning.
- Set up **office hours** or open Q&A sessions to support users.

## üí° Empower change champions

Peer influence and internal advocacy can make or break adoption efforts.

- Identify and empower **power users** or early adopters to **champion** the change across the organization.
- Encourage them to:
  - Share tips and best practices.
  - Offer peer-to-peer support.
  - Provide feedback for continuous improvement.
- Recognize and support these champions to sustain momentum and increase confidence across the broader user base.
