# Buying Guide Content

There are two main ways you can contribute to the content for the Buying Guides on GitHub: **submitting an issue** and **forking the repository.** Whether you want to suggest a change or share an idea, your input is valuable! 

If you are not familiar with GitHub, we suggest Option 1.

## Option 1: Submitting an Issue (Provide general comments on the content)

If you have a suggestion, question, or idea but don't want to modify the file yourself, submitting an issue is a great way to contribute. Issues help maintainers track ideas and discussions.

### When to Submit an Issue:
- You have a suggestion for improving the guide that requires more context than a pull request.
- You need clarification on something in the content.

### How to Submit an Issue:
1. **Go to the Issues Tab**
   - On the repositoryâ€™s GitHub page, click the "Issues" tab.

2. **Click "New Issue"**
   - Click the green "New Issue" button.

3. **Describe Your Issue Clearly**
   - Provide a descriptive title.
   - Write a detailed explanation of the issue, including specific sections that need improvement.
   - If applicable, suggest alternative wording or structure.

4. **Submit the Issue**
   - Click "Submit new issue" and wait for maintainers or contributors to respond.

## Option 2: Forking the Content

Forking allows you to make direct contributions to the content by editing files, such as this `.MD` file. While it may seem complex at first, hopefully this guide makes it easier. We will do our best to continue improving these instructions.

### Steps to Fork and Contribute:
1. **Fork Our Acquisition-FAR-Buying-Guides Repository**
- Click the "Fork" button in the top-right corner of the repository page.

# Forking vs. Pull Requests: Whatâ€™s the Difference?

âœ… TL;DR:

**Forking** â†’ Makes a personal copy of the content.
- You can freely make changes to this forked repo without affecting the original.

- When youâ€™re ready to suggest changes to the original, you can submit a pull request.

**Pull Request ("PR")** â†’ Submits your changes for review and merging into the original.
- You "request" the original content owner to "pull" in your changes.

- The owner can review, comment, and either approve or reject your changes.


**_You don't always have to fork, but you always have to submit a pull request_**

ðŸ’¡ **Real-World Example**

1. Fork the content â†’ You now have your own version to make changes freely.

2. Make changes â†’ Add new information, suggestopms, tips, improvements or typos in your fork.

3. Create a pull request â†’ Suggest your changes to the original content.

4. GSA Team Reviews â†’ They review, request changes (if needed), or approve your PR.

5. If the PR is approved, the PR is merged â†’ Your changes become part of the original content.
